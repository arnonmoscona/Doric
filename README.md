# Doric - a columnar data store for Java

This is WIP. Not ready for general use.

The closest thing to it out there is druidDB, except that Druid is distributed and requires Hadoop, whereas Doric is intended to handle locally stored data at high speeds (generally for interactive, ad-hoc analytic applications).

Another related project that focuses on a single machine with scale for data analytics is TableSaw (https://github.com/jtablesaw/tablesaw)

The project was extracted from a trading backtesting and parameter tuning project were it was the core of the analytics functionality.
